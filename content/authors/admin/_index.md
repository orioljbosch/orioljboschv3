# About me

Hi there! I am a [PhD candidate](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Research-Students/Oriol-Bosh-Jover/Oriol-Bosch-Jover) at the [Department of Methodology](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology) at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and a [Researcher](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey/entry/-/-/U91787/adscripcion/oriol-bosch) at the [Research and Expertise Centre for Survey Methodology (RECSM)](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey). I hold a BA in Political Science from Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) and an MSc in Survey Methods for Social Research from the University of Essex. Before joining LSE I worked as a Research Officer at the [Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER)](https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/) at the University of Essex.

# My work and research

As a survey methodologist, I specialize in topics related to measurement quality, web and mobile surveys and the use of new data types (e.g. Big Data, mobile apps and sensors and wearables) to enhance or substitute surveys, and the effect of these on data quality. Specifically, my work has explored the impact on data quality of using novel data types to answer survey questions as [images](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439318791515), [voice memos](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439318810715) and [emojis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11135-020-00994-8). Moreover, I have expertise in the use and design of [MultiTrait-MultiMethod (MTMM) experiments](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439317750089) to disentangle the measurement quality of survey questions, and how to improve their design.

I also have experience consulting and collaborating with institutions to improve how they design and conduct surveys. I have worked with the [European Social Survey (ESS)](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/) analysing the quality of their survey questions and their sampling design. Besides, I am or havew been involved in several innovative and exciting projects as the [ERCâ€™S WEB DATA OPP project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/849165), [Netquest Research Lab](https://www.netquest.com/netquest-research-lab) and the [CROss-National Online Survey (CRONOS)](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/methodology/methodological_research/modes_of_data_collection/cronos.html). In terms of experience working with non-departmental public bodies, I have worked as a consultant for the [Money Advice Service](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en), helping them develop a longitudinal survey of people in debt.
